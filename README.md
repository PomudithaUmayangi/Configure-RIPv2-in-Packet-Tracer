🚀 Configuring RIPv2 in Cisco Packet Tracer

🌍 About This Project

This project sets up RIP version 2 (RIPv2) in Cisco Packet Tracer to enable dynamic routing between multiple routers. By configuring RIPv2, we ensure that all devices in the network can communicate seamlessly and reach external destinations.


🎯 What You'll Learn

✔️ Setting up and enabling RIPv2 on multiple routers

✔️ Advertising connected networks dynamically

✔️ Preventing unnecessary routing updates (passive interfaces)

✔️ Sharing a default route to enable internet access

✔️ Testing and verifying network connectivity


🏗 Network Setup

The network consists of:

Three routers (R1, R2, and R3)

Multiple LAN and WAN connections

A Web Server to test external connectivity

R1 acts as the gateway to external networks, while R2 and R3 handle internal routing.


🔧 Configuration Steps

1️⃣ Set up a default route on R1 for external traffic

2️⃣ Enable RIPv2 and disable auto-summary on all routers

3️⃣ Advertise connected networks to allow route sharing

4️⃣ Prevent unnecessary routing updates using passive interfaces

5️⃣ Share the default route with other routers

6️⃣ Save the configurations and test connectivity


✅ How to Verify Everything Works

🔹 Check the routing table on each router – all networks should be visible

🔹 Ping devices across the network – every device should be able to communicate

🔹 Try accessing the Web Server – this confirms external connectivity


🔗 Requirements

📌 Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version recommended)

📌 Basic networking knowledge (helpful, but not required!)
